      <p>
      Using the given data set, we decided it would be an interesting experiment to use machine learning to predict the outcomes of all NA LCS matches played on patches <b>5.11</b> and <b>5.14</b>. During the NA LCS 2015 Summer Split, matches played on <b>5.11</b> were during weeks 4 and 5, and matches played on <b>5.14</b> were the entirety of the playoffs.

      <h3 class="ui horizontal divider header">Methodology</h3>
      <p>
      We used a popular Python library called <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"><b>scikit-learn</b></a> to build our experiment. Specifically, we used a <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.svm"><b>Support Vector Machine</b></a> with a linear kernel (we also experimented with RBF but there wasn't too much difference in the outcome). While scikit-learn is not a difficult library to use, the most challenging aspect was formatting the data to be read into the machine, which only takes in a 2D <a href="http://www.numpy.org/"><b>numpy</b></a> array. To achieve this in a way that represented all of the possible team comps for each team, we used a wide array with size for all possible 126 champions on each team: 126 * 2 + 2 = <b>254</b>. (Plus 2 for patch and match tier). Thus, we can stick a "1" in every slot where the team had a champion, and leave it "0" otherwise&mdash;there's quite a lot of empty slots. Thus, by giving each champion a unique index up to 126, we were able to use this wide array to represent all of the matches conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our <a href="http://github.com/protopizza/ApIsOp/tree/master/ml"><b>ApIsOp/ml</b></a> directory contains all of the work for this experiment. Inside, <a href="http://github.com/protopizza/ApIsOp/blob/master/ml/MatchPredictor.py"><b>MatchPredictor.py</b></a> is our main program which utilizes <a href="http://github.com/protopizza/ApIsOp/blob/master/ml/DataLoader.py"><b>DataLoader.py</b></a> to read and format match data from the data set and <a href="http://github.com/protopizza/ApIsOp/blob/master/ml/MachineLearningModel.py"><b>MachineLearningModel.py</b></a> to actually train and test the machine. <a href="http://github.com/protopizza/ApIsOp/tree/master/ml/lcs_match_data"><b>ApIsOp/ml/lcs_match_data</b></a> contains all of the data we finally fed into our machine to predict the LCS matches, with the final results viewable down below.
      </p>
      <p>
      Upon loading our data set back into our machine to try to predict, we achieved approximately a <b>56%</b> accuracy (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/protopizza/ApIsOp/master/ml/linear-test.txt"><b>test results here</b></a>). Out of the <b>41</b> NA LCS matches, we correctly predicted <b>25</b>, about <b>61%</b>. All of these matches were marked in the machine as the highest tier possible (<b>Diamond+</b>). Considering on how many differing factors can go into a single match other than simply champions chosen, these results surpassed our expectations.
